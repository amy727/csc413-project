# CSC413 Project - Multilabel Bird Audio Classification
This repository contains the code for our CSC413 final project on multilabel bird sound classification.

## Data Processing
The following files contain the code for data processing:
* **data_collection_process.ipynb** contains code for the data collection and preprocessing
* **data_split.ipynb** contains code for splitting the data into training and testing sets

The final preprocessed dataset was too large to be uploaded to GitHub but can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vHEBR_4qyi5BfQyfb5h4IZrYIw57qMc7/view?usp=sharing 

## Model Implementation and Evaluation
The following files contain the code for the different model implementations and evaluations:
* **naive_bayes.ipynb** contains code for the baseline Naive Bayes implementation and evaluation
* **dcnn.ipynb** contains code for the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) implementation and evaluation
* **audio_transformer.ipynb** contains code for the Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation and evaluation
